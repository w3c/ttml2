<p>This is the First Candidate Recommendation (CR1) of the Timed Text
Markup Language &versionOfTT; (TTML&versionOfTT;), and is intended to
be progressed to a W3C Recommendation. If you wish to make comments
regarding this document, please file an <loc
href="https://github.com/w3c/ttml2/issues">issue on GitHub</loc> or
send email to <loc

<loc
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/">archives</loc>)
with a subject line starting with <code>[ttml2]</code>.  W3C publishes
a Candidate Recommendation to indicate that the document is believed
to be stable and to encourage implementation by the developer
community. This Candidate Recommendation is expected to advance to
Proposed Recommendation no earlier than 10 April 2018.</p>

<p>For this specification to exit CR, the following criteria must be
met, as documented in the Working Group's <loc
href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TTML/TTML2ImplementationReport">implementation
report</loc>. For each feature introduced in this specification:</p>

<olist>
  <item><p>At least two independent implementations must support the
  feature. If both transformation semantics and presentation semantics
  are defined for the feature, then at least one implementation must
  be a transformation processor and at least one implementation must
  be a presentation processor;</p></item>
  <item><p>At least one of those implementations must be a validating
  processor that successfully verifies valid or invalid use of the
  feature as applicable.</p></item>
</olist>

<p>The following features are at-risk, and may be dropped during the CR period:</p>

<p>The term “at-risk” is a W3C Process term-of-art, and does not
necessarily imply that the feature is in danger of being dropped or
delayed. It means that the Working Group believes the feature may have
difficulty being interoperably implemented in a timely manner, and
marking it as such allows the Working Group to drop the feature if
necessary when transitioning to the Proposed Recommendation stage
without having to publish a new Candidate Recommendation omitting the
feature.</p>
